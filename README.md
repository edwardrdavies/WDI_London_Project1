# WDI London Project 1

####My first WDI London Project, a JavaScript game. 

The game is an RGB colour guessing game, whereby users get to select between difficulty levels of 'easy' and 'hard'. The RGB colour is automatically generated randomly at the top and the user will need to select which colour matches the colour code presented. The fewer guesses it takes for users to select the correct colour, the more points recieved, in hard mode you will have the chance to recieve more points that in easy mode.
